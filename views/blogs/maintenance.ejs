                <p class="blog-description">
                    Imagine stepping into your garden on a bright summer morning, only to find your beloved plants
                    looking like they just woke up on the wrong side of the bed—leaves curling inwards, drooping, or
                    twisting in strange directions. Yep, that’s leaf curl, and it’s your plant’s way of waving a little
                    distress flag.

                    Worried about keeping your plants properly hydrated this summer? We understand! Summer watering is a
                    serious concern for plant parents everywhere because plants that generally need water only once a
                    week, suddenly seem to dry out within two days.

                    Unfortunately, overwatered plants are a more common issue than you'd think. It can get pretty
                    difficult to gauge whether or not you've watered your plant enough and sometimes, you might just pour
                    a little extra thinking it wasn’t enough.

                    Knowing how, when, and how much to water your indoor plants is quite literally the key to keeping them
                    alive. While to some this might come as second nature, it isn’t easy for everyone - especially when
