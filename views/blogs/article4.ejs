            <!-- Introductory paragraphs -->
            <p>Summer is a great season for growing vegetables in your kitchen garden. Vegetable plants that like to grow under full sunshine, enjoy long days and a warmer climate and thrive well in the harsh Indian summer.</p>

                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/f2.webp" alt="Brinjal Plant">
            </div>

                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/plant3.webp" alt="Chili Plant">
            </div>
            <p>Looking to grow a spice in your vegetable garden? Chili as a spice is very popular in India and some of the most pungent varieties of chilies are grown in the hot summer season.</p>

                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/f4.webp" alt="Pumpkin Plant">
